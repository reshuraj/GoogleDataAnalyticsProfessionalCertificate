I finished the certificate program recently, working on the case. It was a fun challenge, and I learned a lot from it.\n\n\n**Scenario**\n\nA junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. They have two types of users:\n* Members - who have annual memberships and\n* Casuals - who rides with a single-ride or full-day passes. \nThe director of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore,analytics team want to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.\n\nTo complete the case study, I followed the six phases involved in data analysis : **Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share and Act**\n\n**Ask**\n\nIn this phase of data analysis, there are two key tasks : \n1. Identify the business task\n2. Consider key stakeholders\n\nDeliverables :\n1. Problem : How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?\n1. Stakeholders : The manager and executive team\n\n**Prepare**\n\nThe data is on an AWS server where it is easily downloadable and named correctly. I have downloaded the previous 12 months data (from july 2021 to june 2022)and stored it locally for the next steps in the anlysis process. The data is under a license and is of first-party type. So it is reliable and original, comprehensive, current, and cited.\n\n**Process**\n\nDownloaded data set are in zipped form so unzip them and store in a subfolder for .CSV files.\n\nThe processing of data for the analysis starts here:\n\nFirstly, Install and load all required packages and libraries in RStudio.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"install.packages(\"tidyverse\")\ninstall.packages(\"janitor\")\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(janitor)\nlibrary(ggplot2)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-08-28T22:13:08.695567Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-08-28T22:13:08.737780Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-08-28T22:13:21.514999Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"STEP 1 : IMPORTING DATA \n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"jul_2021 <- read.csv(\"../csvs/202107-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\naug_2021 <- read.csv(\"../csvs/202108-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\nsep_2021 <- read.csv(\"../csvs/202109-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\noct_2021 <- read.csv(\"../csvs/202110-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\nnov_2021 <- read.csv(\"../csvs/202111-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\ndec_2021 <- read.csv(\"../csvs/202112-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\njan_2022 <- read.csv(\"../csvs/202201-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\nfeb_2022 <- read.csv(\"../csvs/202202-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\nmar_2022 <- read.csv(\"../csvs/202203-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\napr_2022 <- read.csv(\"../csvs/202204-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\nmay_2022 <- read.csv(\"../csvs/202205-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\njun_2022 <- read.csv(\"../csvs/202206-divvy-tripdata.csv\")\n\n","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"STEP 2 : WRANGLE DATA AND COMBINE INTO SINGLE DATAFRAME\n\nBefore merging make sure that the structure of all the files are the same.

On the weekend, casuals riders have the most data points.\n* Casuals riders have more ride length (ride duration) than members.\n* Busiest season is summer. There is an increase in number of rides in the weekends with a bigger volume of bikers in the afternoon.\n* Members have a bigger preference for classic bikes, followed by electric bike.\n* Members have a more fixed use for bikes for routine activities. Where as casual rider's usage is different, mostly all activiy in the weekend.\n\n**SUGGESTIONS**\n1. Offer additional benefits like priority for annual members over casual riders during rush hours of the day/week, less waiting time and preferred bike type.\n2. Launch recreation centres near popular stations in order to attract riders. And a preference or discounts for members over casual riders.\n3. Discount for members for reffering others and to those who completes 5 years to show we value and respect our clients.\n\n\n\nThanks for reading and I hope you like it.\nPlease give your valuable feedback.","metadata":{}}]}
